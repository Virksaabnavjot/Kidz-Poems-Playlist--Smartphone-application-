Kidz Poem Playlist, is an smartphone app project. The app makes a dynamically growing list of items(poems) 
in the user interface when new entry is added to the database i.e the app is connected to the database and 
when new poem is added to the database along with the image,video and name of Poem appears automatically 
within the app , without need of updating the whole app ( .apk file).

The app is targeted to small kids and a trail and full version of the app are developed, 
the source code of Trail version is available on my Github account.
